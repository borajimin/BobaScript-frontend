       Each boxes represents a tea shop
       and each color of the boxes represent the types of tea.
       Jasmine tea shops are light green, chai tea shops are chai,
       earlgrey tea shops are brown, Fran's house is black.
       From the left side of the canvas to right, each shops are named with
       with the type and the instance of it. For example, the chai shop in
       upper left corner is named 'chai1'.`,

       Upon touching the green square, it's value will increase by 2,
       while the red sqaure's value will increase by 3.
       Devise an algorithm in BobaScript to modify the values
       of both respective squares so that they equal each other. To refer to the
       two squares, use the name "green" and "red".`
